Lab 7: Captain's Log<br>

###Lab Objectives###

	1. Practice with data persistence via local storage
	2. Practice using jQuery
	
###Lab Results###

1) Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.<br/>

	1. Users entering in log entries will have them dynamically appear on the page 
	with the most recent entries appearing at the top.  Each log entry has a time stamp 
	associated with it followed by the corresponding text.

	Example) Sun Mar 29, 2015 16:05:32 GMT-0400 (EDT) - Beam me up Scotty!
	
	2. Messages are stored in local storage.  Thus, if a user leaves the page and 
	returns, their messages will be preserved and redisplayed.
	
	3. In addition to using jQuery for this assignment, I also was able to experiment 
	a bit with HTML5 audio elements.  I leveraged the jQuery framework to dynamically 
	add HTML elements to the index.html page and as was able to avoid modifying the 
	HTML that was given to us in index.html directly.
