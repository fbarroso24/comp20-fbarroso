Exploratory Visualizations of Olympic Games Data Throughout the Years

FEATURES:
- Globe (WebGL) with spikes representing total medals a certain country got for each year
    dependent on year selected
    would like to add option to select multiple years and show the sum for all of those years
- D3 for a barchart
    top x number of countries along with medal count
    dependent on years selected
    interactivity: hover has a pop-up of which country
    toggle between total medal count vs. total bronze/silver/gold medals
- Bootstrap
    - picture carousel with relevant photos per year
            have the globe rotate depending on what picture is shown in the carousel (initially)
    - table of athlete medal count
            depending on year(s) selected, it updates accordingly
- JQuery used to manipulate everything

Things it would allow a user to do:
- Explore data and see trends throughout the years
- Through the globe, see which countries even participated and whether there are large areas that are not part of the Olympics at all
- 




IDEAS:
- flattened map of the world -> color-coded continents (or country - just color it) based off amount of participation in a particular year; dots for countries that participated that year
    - currently using: https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/blob/master/README.md#getting-started
    - http://www.d3noob.org/2013/03/a-simple-d3js-map-explained.html
    - https://d3-geomap.github.io/map/choropleth/world/
- bar chart -> x-axis: continents, y-axis: fraction/percentage of total countries in that continent that participated in Olympic that year
- pie charts -> one per continent, split by country/medal count; have one overall one split by medal count per continent; radius corresponding to medals won total in that continent
- WebGL Globe -> self rotating; shows medal count per country (example: http://seminar.mmc.nsu.ru/en.php)
- Olympic "podium"
- ratio of # of participants/medals won (or vice versa)


-figure out active year
-figure out which country based off country code
    country code = class name for that country
